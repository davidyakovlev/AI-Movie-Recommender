# AI Movie Recommender
Personal project that recommends movies based on movies watched and logged on Letterboxd (https://letterboxd.com/) and user inputs.

As Letterboxd does not have a public API, the data will need to be exported from Letterboxd, which creates a csv file, and imported into this program.
